# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection
Overview
<br>
This project demonstrates how to detect vehicle number plates using computer vision and deep learning. The solution utilizes OpenCV for image processing and EasyOCR for optical character recognition (OCR). The process involves reading an image, preprocessing it to identify edges, finding contours to locate the number plate, and using OCR to extract text from the detected plate.
